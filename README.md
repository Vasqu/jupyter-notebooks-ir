# Jupyter Notebooks for Information Retrieval



## Introduction

This repository contains jupyter notebooks that are meant to introduce various concepts
regarding the topic of information retrieval. You may clone the repository and run it locally
on your own device or use [jupyter binder](#jupyter-binder). 
- If you choose to run it locally, you may use the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file to install the necessary 
dependencies.
- If you choose to go with binder, be aware that it may take a while to start until you can run the notebooks 
(up to a few minutes).
